PHASE 2 PROJECT!

9/26/23 - Ended needing to complete favorite functionality

## TO DO

    - Create Favorites toggle and button <button added to artwork> <toggle function on Gallery>
                            <http://localhost:3000/Favorites>
    - CSS
This is a presentation of selected artwork from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. This is a React app using client-side routing to present a Home page, Gallery page, and Favorites page. The app relies on a db.json server with two arrays of objects, one with content populating the Gallery page, and the other populating the Favorites page based on POST requests made via artwork on the Gallery page and DELETE requests from either the Gallery or Favorites page.

The app has various other functionality, including interstitial popup image based on click events on images in Gallery and Favorites to open and on the interstitial image to close; audio files that autoplay if the user is on Home, Gallery, or Favorites; and an embedded video that autoplays on a loop in Home.
